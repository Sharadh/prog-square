* [sk]: Update 4 Oct 16 - Happy with logic. Next step: get large and interesting data. Try:
    * StackOverflow / Reddit for <Question, Snipper> pairs
        - Research xkcd-related script to pull answers from SO
    * CodeAcademy; Hour of Code : open datasets?
    * Code.org: Mail for research related access 
* [sk]: Update ? Oct 16 - Missed an update in the middle: worked on the visualization since that became urgent. Good stuff done, with one outstanding issue regarding overlapping links.
* [sk]: Update 1 Nov 16 - c++ isn't something we're doing anytime soon, so removing that third-party data immediately. Also, looks like a good dataset of problems and solutions is at [PracticePython](http://www.practicepython.org/), which might be cool to model our graphs on.
* [sk]: Update 19 Nov 16 - lots of stuff done on the visualization side. Moved to a Flask-based microservice to support snippet endpoints. Refactored visualization and added snippet view. Graph view is also neater: edges overlap less, and only relevant edges highlight on hover. Cherry on the cake: added README.md
